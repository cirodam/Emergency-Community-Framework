 * The Community Treasury is the shared budget account for the community.
 *
 * Funded by two sources:
 *  1. A share of every new adult member's join endowment (the circulating
 *     fraction after the insurance pool allocation).
 *  2. Monthly community dues collected from all member accounts
 *     (communityDuesRate). This is distinct from Central Bank demurrage:
 *     demurrage retires kin from circulation; dues move kin from
 *     members to the treasury for the community to spend.
 *
 * Spending is a governance act — referenda and domain budget allocations
 * determine where funds go. The treasury has no opinion on outflows.
