/**
 * The Social Insurance Bank maintains the community retirement pool.
 *
 * As a FunctionalDomain it participates fully in community governance.
 *
 * Every member contributes to the pool on joining (join endowment) and on each
 * birthday (one person-year of kin). On retirement, members receive equal monthly
 * payments drawn from the pool. On departure, the member's unspent entitlement
 * (contributed − received) is burned, shrinking the supply to match the living
 * population.
 *
 * The pool account is excluded from demurrage — it holds deferred liabilities,
 * not circulating kin. Pass `socialInsuranceBank.poolAccountId` in the
 * `excludeAccountIds` array when calling `CentralBank.applyDemurrage()`.
 *
 * All monetary operations (deposits to / withdrawals from the pool) are
 * performed by the caller (CentralBank) using `BankClient.transfer()`. This
 * class is responsible only for pool accounting and payout mechanics.
